# GodotVitaSystemTest
A Godot mini tool to test various things so you can debug and tinker with simple parts before doing your big project.

This project is focused on creating homebrew for the PS Vita. However you should be able to reuse everything for any other platform, as long as you have the sdk and templates for such system.

## How to build:
Grab the files in the repository or make a fork and open the project with your godot engine, and you're set.

If you're going to make homebrew for the vita, you can grab the engine and templates here: https://github.com/SonicMastr/godot-vita

## How to use:
The idea in mind is to use each section as a means to test and tinker with different godot resources, but you can update any existing one to a more complicated versions.

The main folder os_test is the full project with assets, with every subfolder being a new different screen to test
The liveArea folder is only required for PS Vita projects, to those who want to see a nice bubble and background.

## Disclaimer
Everything in this repository has been tested, some features work and some don't but nothing should break your machine. However, the files are provided "as is" use them under your own responsibility.

## About credits and License
Although the idea, design and most chunks of code are mine, I've also used assets with free and open licenses, if you want more info about any of them, go to the "credits.txt" file to know where they come from.
